How to start the project locally:

`cd client`

`npm run dev`

in the console you will see URLs for frontend (e.g. Local:   http://localhost:5173/)

and also the 'Server started on port 3000', which means the url of the server: http://localhost:3000

To build the client and make it run on server url:

`cd client`

`yarn build`

Then you can open your webapp frontend on the server url: http://localhost:3000
